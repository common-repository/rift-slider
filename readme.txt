The Rift Slider is an image slider plugin.  You can create image slides with text and content and attach them to a carousel.  You are able to display these 
carousels on your website, displaying to your users exciting information in a unique way.  The Rift Slider uses the latest transformation techniques to 
split the image and use effects to give a unique feel to your slider.

The Rift Slider is fully web responsive so that you get the same effect on mobiles and tablets.  With responsive design your slider will
not disappear off the edge of the screen but will elegantly shrink in size to fit the device it is being viewed on, keeping that all
important visual effect.

Requires WordPress 3.5 and PHP 5.3

You can use the slider to display:

* Photos
* Advertisements
* Messages
* Or any other image and text.
